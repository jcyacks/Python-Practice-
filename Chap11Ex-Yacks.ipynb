Write a ShiftSupervisor class that is a subclass of the Employee class you greates in Programming Excersise 1. The ShiftSupervisor class should keep a data attribute for the annual salary, and a data attribute for the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a ShfitSupervisor object. "
